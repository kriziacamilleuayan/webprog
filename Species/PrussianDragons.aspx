              <p  style="color: #999999">A Japanese breed also capable of vitriol.The Ka-Riu is one of only three known breeds of dragons that are capable of vitrolic attack. The other two are the Copacati and the Longwing.In Japanese mythology, the Ka-Riu was a small dragon; seven feet long, that was scarlet-coloured, and in some versions made of fire. It was one of several "Dragon Kings", including Sui Riu, Han-Riu, Ri-Riu, Fuku Riu & Hai-riyo. Because the two known Japanese dragon breeds use these names, it could be assumed that the other names are as yet unseen breeds.</p>

              <p><b><span class="red">Sui Riu</span></b></p>
              <p  style="color: #999999">A Japanese heavy weight which extends well over 200 feet in length, more than twice the size of the largest dragons in Europe, with deep greenish black scales. Incapable of flight, they instead possess 'water sacs' or 'glands' that increase their volume and mass depending on the body of water available to them. On land, they are the size of a Yellow Reaper, a middleweight. They become much larger when they enter rivers and lakes, and truly gargantuan if they enter the ocean, their body colour also changes paler as they expand. The Sui Riu is extraordinarily similar to a sea serpent in appearance, with the sole points of physical difference being the limbs and the stubby wings. Like the sea serpent, it can breathe underwater, but it possesses a keen intellect as well as the ability to ingest and violently expel large qualities of water. They are also capable of heating and discharging boiling water, if required. The Sui Riu is also more long lived than European dragons with a life span in excess of four hundred years.</p>
